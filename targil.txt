1. create a table called contacts with:
    primary key: contact_id integer 
    first_name: text , cannot be null
    last_name: text , cannot be null
    email: text , cannot be null (*bonus: must be unique)
    phone: text , cannot be null (*bonus: must be unique)
    **crazy-bonus-- time_of_creation: text , cannot be null --> will contain the time of time_of_creation
            [you need to add it to your INSERT queries...)]
2. drop the table
    check to see if it was deleted
    now, create it again
3. insert 3 of your contacts
    select all rows (all fields)
4. update the last contact with a new phone number
    select only the row you updated (with columns: only contact_id, first_name, phone) [use where]
5. insert 1 malicious contact (hacker)
    select this row [use where]
6. quickly delete this row
7. use select to verify this contact was removed
